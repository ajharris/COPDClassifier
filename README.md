# COPDClassifier
v2, OOP

COPDClassifier main.py takes two arguments, the folder path where the classification data resides in an Excel spreadsheet, and the folder where the original unclassified dicom images are held.  The patient file structure is copied into a folder COPD or NCOPD as sorted.

NOTE: If the source and destination folder are on the same network drive, the process is very fast.
